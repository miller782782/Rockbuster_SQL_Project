# Rockbuster_SQL_Project
The work here is for Achievement 3 of CareerFoundry's Data Analyst course.  This SQL project worked with data from the fictional company Rockbuster Stealth LLC.  The company is meant to be a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world however, facing stiff competition from streaming services the Rockbuster management team is planning to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive 

The project required me to use SQL to analyse the data in Rockbuster's relational database management system to answer business questions that the company had.
