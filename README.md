# Rockbuster_SQL_Project

The work here is for Achievement 3 of CareerFoundry's Data Analyst course.  This SQL project worked with data from the fictional company Rockbuster Stealth LLC.  


### Objective

The company is meant to be a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world however, facing stiff competition from streaming services the Rockbuster management team is planning to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive 

The project required me to use SQL to analyse the data in Rockbuster's relational database management system to answer business questions that the company had.


### Data

The data was from Rockbuster's relational database which can be found [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip).
The data dictionary including ERD is included in the files.

### Tools

The SQL queries were written and executed using PostgreSQL which can be downloaded [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).
